## Detailed Business Rules

### RULE-CALC-007: Bill Payment Balance Update Calculation
**Rule ID**: RULE-CALC-007  
**Rule Description**: Updates account current balance by subtracting the payment amount for bill payment processing  
**COBOL Source Location**: COBIL00C.cbl, line 234  
**Involved Variables**: 
- Input: `ACCT-CURR-BAL` (current account balance)
- Input: `TRAN-AMT` (transaction amount)
- Output: `ACCT-CURR-BAL` (updated account balance after payment)

**Input Conditions**: 
- After user confirms bill payment
- Transaction amount is set to current account balance (full payment scenario)
- Before updating the account data file

**Calculation Logic**: 
```cobol
COMPUTE ACCT-CURR-BAL = ACCT-CURR-BAL - TRAN-AMT
```

**Business Impact**: This rule implements the core financial logic for processing bill payments by reducing the account balance by the payment amount, effectively clearing the outstanding balance.
